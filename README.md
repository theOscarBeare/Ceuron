# Ceuron
Project to create a Neural Networks Libary

# Current Features
The project can currently run a feed forward neural network. This is a network with only one layer therefore without a hidden layer.

# Usage
```python
import Ceuron

Ceuron.buildFFNN("ReLu", 20, Data, Targets) # ReLu is the transfer function, 20 the number of epochs
